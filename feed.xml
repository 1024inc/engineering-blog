From customer support to data analysis, organizations are deploying agents that make decisions, call APIs, and generate responses autonomously. But this raises a fundamental question: how do you test something that produces non-deterministic outputs? Traditional software testing relies on deterministic assertions. Given inp... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Mocking requests to third party services</title><link href="https://1024inc.github.io/engineering-blog//posts/mocking-requests-to-third-party-services/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mocking requests to third party services" /><published>2022-08-09T19:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2022-08-10T05:28:29-05:00</updated> <id>https://1024inc.github.io/engineering-blog//posts/mocking-requests-to-third-party-services/</id> <content src="https://1024inc.github.io/engineering-blog//posts/mocking-requests-to-third-party-services/" /> <author> <name>Yiorgos Krypotos</name> </author> <summary> Third party services are frequently used to extend the functionality of our product/service, especially in cases where what is needed grows beyond the limits of our industry or purpose. Once an integration is set up and running, naturally this must be included in our automation tests, right? (right?) It is a widely accepted practice to always mock requests made to third party services while te... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Tools to backfill large PostgreSQL tables (part 1)</title><link href="https://1024inc.github.io/engineering-blog//posts/tools-to-backfill-large-postgresql-tables-pt1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tools to backfill large PostgreSQL tables (part 1)" /><published>2022-05-31T19:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2022-06-01T02:26:08-05:00</updated> <id>https://1024inc.github.io/engineering-blog//posts/tools-to-backfill-large-postgresql-tables-pt1/</id> <content src="https://1024inc.github.io/engineering-blog//posts/tools-to-backfill-large-postgresql-tables-pt1/" /> <author> <name>Tamas Simak</name> </author> <summary> At Beyond we are mainly using PostgreSQL databases for our services, consisting of over a hundred tables. With some of the largest ones we’ve already had a few close calls as they were reaching the maximum supported 32TB table size - but that’s a story for another day. Backfilling tables that large is not a trivial task, assuming we want to perform it safely, and within a reasonable timeframe. ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Empathy and Compassion in Communication (part 2)</title><link href="https://1024inc.github.io/engineering-blog//posts/empathy-and-compassion-in-communication-part-2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Empathy and Compassion in Communication (part 2)" /><published>2022-04-11T23:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2022-05-01T16:47:51-05:00</updated> <id>https://1024inc.github.io/engineering-blog//posts/empathy-and-compassion-in-communication-part-2/</id> <content src="https://1024inc.github.io/engineering-blog//posts/empathy-and-compassion-in-communication-part-2/" /> <author> <name>Francois Toubol</name> </author> <summary> Effective engineers are strong problem solvers.
