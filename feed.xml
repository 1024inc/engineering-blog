Once an integration is set up and running, naturally this must be included in our automation tests, right? (right?) It is a widely accepted practice to always mock requests made to third party services while te... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Tools to backfill large PostgreSQL tables (part 1)</title><link href="https://1024inc.github.io/engineering-blog//posts/tools-to-backfill-large-postgresql-tables-pt1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tools to backfill large PostgreSQL tables (part 1)" /><published>2022-05-31T19:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2022-06-01T02:26:08-05:00</updated> <id>https://1024inc.github.io/engineering-blog//posts/tools-to-backfill-large-postgresql-tables-pt1/</id> <content src="https://1024inc.github.io/engineering-blog//posts/tools-to-backfill-large-postgresql-tables-pt1/" /> <author> <name>Tamas Simak</name> </author> <summary> At Beyond we are mainly using PostgreSQL databases for our services, consisting of over a hundred tables. With some of the largest ones we’ve already had a few close calls as they were reaching the maximum supported 32TB table size - but that’s a story for another day. Backfilling tables that large is not a trivial task, assuming we want to perform it safely, and within a reasonable timeframe. ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Empathy and Compassion in Communication (part 2)</title><link href="https://1024inc.github.io/engineering-blog//posts/empathy-and-compassion-in-communication-part-2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Empathy and Compassion in Communication (part 2)" /><published>2022-04-11T23:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2022-05-01T16:47:51-05:00</updated> <id>https://1024inc.github.io/engineering-blog//posts/empathy-and-compassion-in-communication-part-2/</id> <content src="https://1024inc.github.io/engineering-blog//posts/empathy-and-compassion-in-communication-part-2/" /> <author> <name>Francois Toubol</name> </author> <summary> Effective engineers are strong problem solvers.

Shipping early is a good way to get feedback, to quickly iterate and improve on code, break wrong assumptions, rearrange logic and fix unexpected (hopefu... </summary> </entry> </feed>
