## Welcome to Engineering Paths @ Beyond!

### What are Engineering Paths?
- What it is
- What it is not

### Why do we publish engineering paths?
- Positive framing
- What's in it for me?
- What's in it for my manager?
- What's in it for our relationship?
- What's in in for Beyond?

### Contributions that aren't covered here
We tried to be quantitative, precise, and Beyond specific in building these career paths. While it’s important to evaluate everyone against the same explicit standards, we also recognize that our levels can’t possibly cover every form of contribution to the organization. Our promotion packets provide space to describe and contextualize contributions that don’t fit our criteria but ought to be considered. Every role description builds on top of the previous one. What is descriptive for one role is implicitly descriptive for the next one as well

### Promotion philosophy
Promotions are **descriptive**, not prescriptive: We promote engineers and managers when they have demonstrated that they are consistently performing at the next level. Promotions don’t unlock new responsibilities; the new responsibilities and increased scope come first, and then we recognize it with a promotion. Please keep in mind, roles build on top of each other. What is descriptive for one role is implicitly descriptive for the next one too.

As you grow through the engineering paths, your impact on Beyond will grow exponentially. Therefore, every step along your path will require more time to develop. For example, Software Engineer 2 to Sr Software Engineer is a more significant step than any other before. Sr Software Engineer 2 to Staff Engineer or to TL/EM, and every step beyond are larger and will require at least 2 years of development. At Sr Software Engineer 2 / TL/EM, there’s no longer a default expectation that you’ll eventually be promoted so that you can stay at this level indefinitely, and that's totally fine. You will be able to continue to grow breadth-wise and be recognized for it. There simply aren't as many roles available passed that point.

In the end, it is on you to be your own advocate! 
> “Every promotion I’ve ever gotten has been me saying: I am operating at this level, I have done all of these things, I think I am ready for the next level, and here is why. Your contributions should never be ambiguous — document them! Make a list for yourself — about what you do, and how it impacts the company. Advocating for yourself isn’t arrogance: You are giving your manager details about things you are working on.”

### Compensation philosophy
We hold ourselves accountable to be equitable. Therefore, we are constantly monitoring and updating our salary bands according to market data. These bands are related to the different roles on the engineering paths and are wide enough to allow for compensation increases even outside the scope of a promotion.
