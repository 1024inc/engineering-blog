## Knowledge Sharing Communities

Guilds and Communities are voluntary groups of engineers who share a common interest in a specific topic or technology. These communities exist to accelerate collective learning, share best practices, and build expertise across our engineering organization.

### Active Communities

| Community | Focus Area | Slack Channel |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| [Coding with AI](coding-with-ai.html) | AI tooling, patterns, and best practices for development | #ai-coding |
| [Frontend](frontend.html) | Frontend engineering excellence, consistency, and collaboration | #dev-front-end |
| [Data](data.html) | Data driven decision making, best practices, and governance | #dev-data |

### Why Join a Guild?

- **Learn from peers** who face similar challenges
- **Share your expertise** and help others grow
- **Stay current** on rapidly evolving technologies
- **Build connections** across teams and domains
- **Shape best practices** that benefit the whole organization

### Starting a New Community

Interested in starting a new Guild or CoK? Reach out to your Engineering Manager or post in #dev-team with your proposal. A good community has:

- A clear purpose and scope
- At least 3-5 interested members
- A volunteer host or rotating hosts
- A dedicated Slack channel for async discussion
