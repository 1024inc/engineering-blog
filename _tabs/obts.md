# What are Objective-Based Teams (OBTs)?
An Objective-based team (OBT) is the unit by which we organize product delivery work. They are meant to be cross-functional and often operate independently as one self-sufficient unit, and they include all resources necessary for product delivery. Typically, an OBT comprises a Product Manager, FE/BE/Data Engineers, a UX Designer, and an Engineering Manager. Sometimes, this cross-functional structure expands to other business functions such as sales, marketing, or implementation. 

You can find our OBT structure [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18J12aBi0AG-rJZZ_Mq8PFW79I1-traPjmsdpP5QTCNc/edit#slide=id.g1bf23f2d1d1_0_113), and our OBT directory [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_Qm4_zleTy5SYAJj8fGqEGJcjNm2wb0mlUPcLCsC1lI/edit#gid=1105910315) _(Internal links)_

We differentiate 3 types of OBTs:
- **Product OBTs**: (Also known as stream-aligned teams) are aligned to a flow of work from (usually) a segment of the business domain
- **Platform OBTs**: Provide a compelling internal product that accelerates the delivery of multiple Product OBTs
- **Enabling OBTs**:  Provide support to other OBTs, and other business teams by detecting gaps and helping fill these gaps

# Within OBTs, each player is responsibile for one, or sometimes more, of the following roles:
## Product Manager (PM)
_Explores the why and what_
- Estimates impact pre refinement
- Builds measurable outcomes
- Prioritize the team's backlog and builds the team's roadmap
- Drives refinement and documents story and acceptance criteria
- Communicates commitments with customers and business stakeholders

## Tech Lead (TL)
_Defines the what and how_
- Estimates effort pre refinement
- Decides on technical solutions
- Documents designs
- Participates in cross-teams and engineering-driven initiatives
- Owns timelines when required

_Tech lead is not a position on our engineering paths. Instead, it is a set of responsibilities that senior engineers sometimes assume as part of their growth and development_

## Developer (Dev)
_Builds all the things!_
- Participates in refinement and estimating stories
- Delivers work assignments on time and on target
- Collaborates with teammates when necessary through pairing and other sessions
- Takes ownership to iterate and improve when possible
- Gradually gains and share codebase knowledge through pairing and documenting

## Engineering Manager (EM)
_Coaches and enables the team_
- Coaches engineers' growth and champions their promotions
- Plans required teams' design and resources
- Facilitates and mediates teams' meetings
- Manages and provides clear continuous feedback on engineers' performance
- Provides a weekly 121 platform for engineers' engagement and removing obstacles

If you have any doubt or question, please chat with your EM, or contact us in slack @dev-team-em, thank you! üôèüèª
