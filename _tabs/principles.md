**_We are a team of engineers who are passionate about building together a product that is useful and easy to use. We are doing so by following our engineering principles:_**


## Reduce scope
   - The best way to ship more stuff is to ship smaller!
   - The best way to ship safely is to ship often!

## Ship early
   - Getting feedback as early as possible even if the project/feature isnâ€™t 100% there
   - While we control radius with feature flags to reduce risk and deliver value to our customers

## Iterate and improve
   - Once you got the feedback, go back and improve. As we ship and iterate, we plan for the future as well
   - We measure what we ship to iterate and improve based on data

## Take ownership
   - Owning the code we shipped as we are the expert and knows best
   - Sharing your knowledge by documenting, pairing and training, because sharing is caring

## Deliver value
   - At the end of the day we are here to make Beyond a successful business and drive revenue
   - As we focus on our customers and their experience we are bound to do so
