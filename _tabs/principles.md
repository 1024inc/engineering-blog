**We are a fun bunch of devs passionate about collaborating and building easy to use, valuable products. To do so, we abide by the following princilpes**


## We reduce scope
   - The best way to ship more stuff is to ship smaller!
   - The best way to ship safely is to ship often!

## We ship early
   - Getting feedback as early as possible even if the project/feature isnâ€™t 100% there
   - While we control radius with feature flags to reduce risk and deliver value to our customers

## We iterate and improve
   - Once you got the feedback, go back and improve. As we ship and iterate, we plan for the future as well
   - We measure what we ship to iterate and improve based on data

## We take ownership
   - Owning the code we shipped as we are the expert and knows best
   - Sharing your knowledge by documenting, pairing and training, because sharing is caring

## We deliver value
   - At the end of the day we are here to make Beyond a successful business and drive revenue
   - As we focus on our customers and their experience we are bound to do so
