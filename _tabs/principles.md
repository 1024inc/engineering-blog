**We are a bunch of passionate devs having fun building easy to use and valuable products together. To do so, we follow these princilpes**

## We reduce scope
_"Focus Narrow, Deliver Big: Less really is more."_

- What to do
   - Breaking down large features into smaller, manageable chunks to ensure quicker delivery.
   - Prioritizing must-have features over nice-to-have ones to focus on core functionality.
   - Saying “no” to features that don't contribute to the main objective or delaying them for future iterations.

- What to avoid
   - Overcommitting to too many features at once.
   - Spending time on polishing non-essential elements or perfecting UI components before validating the core.
   - Failing to clearly define what’s in or out of scope, leading to scope creep.

## We ship early
_"Ship Sooner, Learn Faster: Early delivery for quicker feedback."_

- What to do
   - Releasing minimum viable products (MVPs) to get feedback from users quickly.
   - Setting aggressive but realistic release targets to avoid endless development cycles.
   - Prioritizing time-to-market over exhaustive development, even if it means the first version has known limitations.

- What to avoid
   - Waiting for a product to be "perfect" before releasing it.
   - Ignoring early customer feedback or postponing releases due to minor issues.
   - Spending too much time on internal polishing without shipping anything.

## We learn, iterate, and improve
_"Learn Fast, Adapt Faster: Every step teaches us something new.""_

- What to do
   - Analyzing feedback from users or customers after each release and using it to shape future iterations.
   - Running experiments and collecting data to inform decisions.
   - Regularly conducting retrospectives to identify what worked well and where improvements are needed.

- What to avoid
   - Sticking rigidly to the original plan without adjusting based on new information.
   - Ignoring feedback or failing to collect it after each iteration.
   - Treating a release as a final solution rather than a stepping stone to the next version.

## We take ownership
_"Own It, Lead It: Great outcomes start with taking responsibility."_

- What to do
   - Owning the entire lifecycle of our code, from development to production and maintenance.
   - Actively engaging in problem-solving, taking responsibility for identifying and fixing issues rather than passing them off.
   - Communicating proactively about project status, blockers, or failures, and following through on commitments. 

- What to avoid
   - Blaming other teams or external factors for project delays or failures.
   - Failing to address production issues promptly or waiting for someone else to solve the problem.
   - Over-relying on QA or others for quality assurance without taking responsibility for testing your own work.

## We drive revenue
_"Build for Impact: Create what counts and drives revenue."_

- What to do
   - Prioritizing features and fixes that have a direct impact on revenue growth, such as improving customer retention or enabling new sales opportunities.
   -  Collaborating with sales, marketing, and product teams to understand how engineering can best support revenue goals.
   - Measuring the impact of releases on key revenue metrics and making adjustments to improve outcomes.

- What to avoid
   - Focusing too much on technical elegance or side projects that don’t have a clear connection to revenue.
   - Neglecting to consider how changes impact the customer experience or the sales cycle, leading to lost revenue opportunities.
   - Building features without clearly understanding how they contribute to customer acquisition, retention, or upsell opportunities.
