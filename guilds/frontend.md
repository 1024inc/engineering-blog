# Frontend Guild

## Purpose

The Frontend guild brings engineers together across OBTs to exchange knowledge, brainstorm solutions, and align on best practices. Our goals are to:

- **Improve consistency, maintainability, and developer experience** across our frontend stack
- **Learn from one another**, surface challenges, and collectively improve tooling, patterns, and practices that make frontend development faster, safer, and more enjoyable
- **Prevent duplicated effort** by collaborating on library choices, code structure decisions, and component development

---

## In Scope

**Core Technologies:**

- React patterns and best practices
- TypeScript usage and type safety
- State management approaches
- Modern JavaScript/ES features

**Performance & Optimization:**

- Core Web Vitals monitoring and improvement
- Bundle size optimization
- Loading performance and lazy loading strategies
- Runtime performance profiling

**Testing & Quality:**

- Unit testing with Jest
- End-to-end testing strategies with Playwright
- Visual regression testing
- Code review standards for frontend code

**Design Systems & Accessibility:**

- Component library development and maintenance

---

## Strategic Alignment

The Frontend guild supports Beyond's engineering strategy through:

- **Consistency at scale** - Ensuring UI components look and behave uniformly across teams
- **Knowledge sharing** - Preventing siloed solutions by surfacing existing components and patterns
- **Informed decision-making** - Collaborative evaluation of libraries, tools, and architectural approaches
- **Continuous improvement** - Driving migrations and updates via a dedicated Jira board
- **Design partnership** - Close collaboration with the Design team to maintain visual coherence
