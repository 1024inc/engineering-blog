# Frontend Guild

## Overview

A knowledge-sharing community focused on frontend engineering excellence, consistency, and collaboration across Beyond's product teams.

## Purpose

The Frontend guild brings together engineers working on user-facing applications to share knowledge, align on best practices, and drive consistency across the codebase. By collaborating on library choices, code structure decisions, and component development, we prevent duplicated effort and ensure a cohesive user experience.

## Key Focus Areas

**Core Technologies:**

- React patterns and best practices
- TypeScript usage and type safety
- State management approaches
- Modern JavaScript/ES features

**Performance & Optimization:**

- Core Web Vitals monitoring and improvement
- Bundle size optimization
- Loading performance and lazy loading strategies
- Runtime performance profiling

**Testing & Quality:**

- Unit testing with Jest
- End-to-end testing strategies with Playwright
- Visual regression testing
- Code review standards for frontend code

**Design Systems & Accessibility:**

- Component library development and maintenance
- Design token management
- Accessibility compliance
- Collaboration with the Design team for UI consistency

**Migrations & Modernization:**

- Dependency updates and version migrations
- Legacy code modernization
- Tooling improvements (bundlers, linters, formatters)

## Strategic Alignment

The Frontend guild supports Beyond's engineering strategy through:

- **Consistency at scale** - Ensuring UI components look and behave uniformly across teams
- **Knowledge sharing** - Preventing siloed solutions by surfacing existing components and patterns
- **Informed decision-making** - Collaborative evaluation of libraries, tools, and architectural approaches
- **Continuous improvement** - Driving migrations and updates via a dedicated Jira board
- **Design partnership** - Close collaboration with the Design team to maintain visual coherence
